It was very challenging to do, but I feel more confident in my ability to create websites. This project took some time, and despite the frequent frustrion I experienced, it still turned out wonderful. Note to self: *make as many drafts of your project as you can. No idea is a bad one, and if you think it is, remind yourself that a bad idea is just an idea you have tried out yet*.

##### Skills acquired:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
